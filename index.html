<p>I have learned so much form Khan Academy, but computer programming is probably the one I've most enjoyed. It's using my creative skills as well as my drawing skills. You can create almost anything with code: a calculator, logo, favorite character, game, visualization, or blog. </p>

<a id="kung-fu" class="anchor" href="#kung-fu" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kung Fu</h3>

<p>I have been doing Kung Fu for almost a year now, and have really enjoyed the experience. I currently have a gold stripe sash (meaning I have a bold belt with one black stripe on it). Knowing any kind of self-defense is really useful, and it has definitely helped me gain confidence.</p>

<a id="art" class="anchor" href="#art" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Art</h3>

<p>Out of all my skills, drawing was my first. As soon as I could hold a pencil, I drew. Even though I've never taken any professional drawing lessons, my skills are always being expanded and improved. Recently I've enjoyed studying the human face - it's just so fascinating. :D</p>

<h3>
<a id="music" class="anchor" href="#music" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Music</h3>

<p>My family is naturally a musical family. My father used to sing in a chamber boys choir, and now conducts a children's choir. He also plays the piano. I play the piano, violin, recorder and tin whistle (although anyone can play tin whistle), and sing.## ### </p>
